Linux software development for media-streaming devices (STBs) and services. Hired to fill two roles: Scrum Master for the Platform team and "toolsmith" developing toolchains, release systems and developer tools to ensure developer productivity



* Implemented rsyslog support to the AminoMOVE CloudTV media backend, enabling its output to be fed to the log collection and analysis tools Splunk and Unomaly allowing production deployment issues to be field issues to be rapidly identified and understood

* Delivered a complete set of demonstrator services used to support the sales team in winning opportunities; including developing the ground-breaking concept of using an Amino STB as the cable to IP turn-around acting as the content source for the Amino's first AWS hosted CloudTV service

* Developed automatic build and release systems to assure the stability of the common code base, aligning build and release processes to eliminating release day delays due to broken configuration

* Migrated software development from CVS to Git including retention of complete version history allowing developers to take advantage of modern version control tool while retaining the ability to go back and understand the decisions behind code implementation.

* Developed and maintained Debian packages for toolchains and common development tools ensuring a consistent build environment and hence reducing developer time tracking down machine specific bugs

* Ensured developer communication, regular knowledge sharing as Scrum Master and team lead for AmiNET firmware, and later AVG (Audio, Video and Graphics) teams

* Developed the company's first Scrum tool using MySQL, perl, HTML and Javascript, automatically synchronised with TestTrack Bug-Tracker allowing consistent prioritised backlogs for each team and reducing administrative burden

* After Amino acquisition of Booxmedia, led the first cross-site team of Amino engineers taking our existing skills in Linux, multimedia decode for consumer devices and re-apply in the the delivery of OTT CloudTV video services 

* Working closing with our client through daily cross-company scrum stand-ups delivered Amino’s first end-to-end Service to screen multi-media video solution delivered through multiple DRM protected ABR formats (HLS, DASH, MSS). Including live streaming services (264 channel), recording services (50+ channels), radio channels, pause liveTV

* Investigated and resolved production issues across the system ranging mobile applications (iOS, Android); HTML5 UI, Web Services (PHP, Yii), media backend (Python); deployment systems (Ansible, Docker), Networking issues (e.g. IGMP)



**Global Graphics** (2008 - 2010)
</table>


Electronic document software; Managed team to deliver PDF workflow software using for Windows



* Formulated framework for developer tests, using QT’s built-in javascript technology. Used to implement tests during module development which were then built into a suite for avoiding regressions in subsequent iterations

* Defined change request tracking processes and then evolved it throughout the project to support team’s constant process improvement



**TTPCom** (2003 - 2008)
</table>


Mobile Telecommunications; GSM, GPRS and the first Intel-based 3G handset. Appointed to provide dedicated engineering support for integration to customers using TTPCom mobile stack. Later moved on to run teams and then then run the support team



* Used in-depth understanding of build tools, TTPCom's release system and Perforce to create a tool chain that brought patches and releases together in a single process and reduced fix delivery times from 1 month to less than 1 day

* Aligned development and client software configurations eliminating time to debug mismatches

* Co-ordinated with other departments to agree a branching and integration strategy allowing a wider range of options to be delivered to future clients

* Wrote Perl scripts which analysed the build options applied to each software module in both development and client profiles pre-emptively identifying and resolving latent defects

* Defined Support Processes for the Motorola WiMAX programme optimising communication with client engineers, while maintaining project control



**Pace Micro Technology** (2000 - 2003)
